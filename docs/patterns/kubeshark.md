# Kubeshark AddOn

[kubeshark](https://github.com/kubeshark/kubeshark)  is an API Traffic Analyzer for Kubernetes providing real-time, protocol-level visibility into Kubernetesâ€™ internal network, capturing and monitoring all traffic and payloads going in, out and across containers, pods, nodes and clusters.


This pattern deploys the following resources:
- Creates EKS Cluster Control plane with managed nodegroup
- Install and set up kubeshark

## Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have installed the following tools on your machine.

1. [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
2. [kubectl](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
3. [cdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install)
4. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install)

## Project Setup
1.) Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/cdk-eks-blueprints-patterns.git
```

2.) Go inside project directory (eg. cdk-eks-blueprints-patterns)

```sh
cd cdk-eks-blueprints-patterns
```

3.) Install project dependencies.

```sh
make deps
```

4.) import kubeshark
```
npm i kubeshark
```
5.) To view patterns and deploy kubeshark pattern, run the below command.
```
make list
cdk bootstrap
make pattern kubeshark deploy
```
## Verify the resources

Run update-kubeconfig command. You should be able to get the command from CDK output message. More information can be found at https://aws-quickstart.github.io/cdk-eks-blueprints/getting-started/#cluster-access
```sh
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <your cluster name> --region <your region> --role-arn arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxx:role/eks-blue1-eksblue1AccessRole32C5DF05-1NBFCH8INI08A
```

1.) verify the resources created by Steps above.
```sh
$ kubectl get deployments -n kube-system

NAME                                                          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
blueprints-addon-kubeshark                               1/1     1            1           20m
```


2.) Access to kubeshark.

```sh
$ kubectl -n kube-system port-forward svc/kubeshark-front 3000:80
```

Open the [dashboard](http://localhost:3000)

Then you should be able to see view like this

3.) deploy nginx pod using the below command.
```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
EOF
```


4.) Try to access "aws.com" to generate traffic flow using the below command.
```
kubectl exec nginx curl https://aws.com
```


5.) Access kubeshark using the below command.
```
kubectl -n kube-system port-forward svc/kubeshark-front 3000:80
```


6.) Run Kubeshark query to identify the traffic flow.
```
(src.pod.metadata.name == "nginx" or dst.pod.metadata name == "nginx") and request.questions[0].name == "aws.com" or (src.name == "nginx" and src.namespace == "default" and dst.name == "kube-dns" and dst.namespace == "kube-system")
```
As shown below, the Kubeshark query used to identify the traffic flowing from the pod "nginx" in the "default" namespace to "aws.com" and "coredns". The query is writen by [Kubeshark Filter Language (KFL)](https://docs.kubeshark.co/en/filtering#kfl-syntax-reference) is the language implemented inside kubeshark/worker that enables the user to filter the traffic efficiently and precisely.

Also you can visualize the traffic flow and bandwidth using service map feature as shown below.

## Cleanup

To clean up your EKS Blueprints, run the following commands:

```sh
make pattern kubeshark destroy 
```

## Disclaimer 
This pattern relies on an open source NPM package [aws-eks-blueprint-addon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubeshark). Please refer to the package npm site for more information.
